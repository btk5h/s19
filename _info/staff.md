  <b> Ran Liu (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hello CS32 students! I’m your TA Ran Liu. You can call me Ran ( pronounce as “than”). I’m a first year Ph.D student interested in security & privacy, database optimization. I got my Master degree in Johns Hopkins University with major in Information Security. After I graduated, I worked 8 months as Application Security Analyst in Las Vegas, where I mainly focused on identifying web application vulnerabilities and fixed them. In my free time, I love video games - PS4, XBOX, SWITCH and road trip. I must say you are in the right class where you can learn a lot to build your skills. If you have any questions, such as course related questions, career advices or just want to find someone to talk to, feel free to come to my office hours and lab sections. Again, I’m very happy to work with you folks and wish you all have a great quarter!" </i>

    <b>George Kripac (Tutor)</b>
    <i> "Hi! My name is George and I’m thrilled to be your lead tutor for CS32! I am a second-year computer science major and have enjoyed helping people understand new concepts since my days tutoring for honors classes in high school. I actually got into UCSB as a CCS Math major and switched into engineering CS nearly a year ago. I have been to numerous Four Eyes Lab meetings here at UCSB and my research interests lie in the field of computer vision. Outside of academics I’m on the UCSB Varsity Sailing Team. Last year we got into the national championships on the east coast so I’m super excited to see how we do this year! I also love playing the piano. I am a classical pianist and since the age of 8 I’ve played works from the likes of Dvořák to Debussy. I’m also obsessed with traveling! Traveling around the globe has opened my eyes to countless vibrant cultures, instilling a strong appreciation for diversity in me. Other things I enjoy doing include listening to music, binge watching Netflix, playing video games, hiking, cooking, and taking pictures. If you have any questions about the course, anything I’ve mentioned, or just want to chat feel free to reach out to me on Piazza!" </i>

    <b>Dylan Kupsh (Tutor) </b>
    <i> "Hey everyone! My name is Dylan and my pronouns are he/him/his. I'm a second year in Computer Science major and I'm super excited to be a mentor for everyone this quarter. Currently, I'm researching tradeoffs of neural networks within hardware in the Computer Architecture Lab under professor Sherwood. Besides progamming, I'm extremely active within our local labor movement and enjoy studying the political economy in my free time. To be successful and learn more in this course, I highly recommend taking advantage of office hours as you never know what you might learn inside them. Otherwise, feel free to contact me and ask any questions you may have!" </i>

  <b> Garrett Lee (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hey! My name’s Garrett (he/him/his) and I’m a first year CCS Computing major. I am really looking forward to being able to work with you all. I believe that the best way to learn is by being able to experience the application of the concepts that you are taught in addition to questioning why things have been implemented the way they are, so by all means if you have are wondering anything at all ask away. My main interest lies in cyber security, you can usually find me competing in CTFs or what I guess you could call "hacking" competitions. The SecLab here is one of the most prominent security research groups out of all the universities, so you’d be doing a disservice to yourself if you don’t check them out. I’m still deciding what concentration of security I want to pursue, although I can say that one of my most favorite categories of CTFs is reverse engineering. If you have any interest at all in the security field, I’d happily be able to discuss it with you! Outside of class, you can usually find me climbing at the MAC or at the bouldering wall in Rob Gym (shoutout to the UCSB Climbing Team!). I’ve got a pretty good idea of the workload for the other CS classes in addition to the professors that you should definitely take and might want to avoid, so if you’ve got questions about schedule planning for the quarters to come, feel free to ask me." </i>

  <b> Andrew Luo (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Andrew and I am a second year C.S. student. I am excited to tutor this quarter because it is a new experience for me and I enjoy helping other students. Some organizations I am involved with are Coders SB and Theta Tau. After this quarter, I will be interning at Cisco in North San Jose, working on IoT related projects. Most of my experience so far has been with web and mobile development. I also enjoy playing video games, graphic design, and going to concerts. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!" </i>
